This is a application that keeps tracks of your expenses, income and monthly savings.
Made as a assignment for Java in my 3rd sem its my first time creating a fully fledged GUI application with DB integration.
Maven was used as my java dependency manager
JavaFX was used for the GUI aspect of the application along with SceneBuilder to build the scenes
Hibernate was used for ORM to store the object datas into the DB
For the DB I used MySQL with mysql connectorj to connect it with the app
